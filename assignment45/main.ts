// Assignment 45

// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.


interface Car {
    manufacturer: string;
    model: string;
    [key: string]: any;
}

function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, options: { [key: string]: any } = {}): Car {
    return { manufacturer, model, ...options };
}

// Calling the function with the required information and additional properties
const myCar = createCar("Toyota", "Corolla", { color: "Blue", optionalFeature: "Sunroof" });

// Print the object to verify all information is stored correctly
console.log(myCar);
